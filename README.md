# Overview
## The following repositories willl be created for all the remaining projects throughout the semester:
#### Project number: 2 (Repository name: API Development)

#### Project number: 3 (Repository name: Patterns & Standards)

#### Project number: 4 (Repository name: Reporting & Monitoring)
# Branching Strategy
The branching strategy that will be employed in each project is that I am gonna be working on the main branch on every project. If a bug arises, I will then create a development branch to fix it.
# .gitignore Usage
In each project, the .gitignore will be used to hide some sensitive files from the public, even though the repositories themselves will  be public.
